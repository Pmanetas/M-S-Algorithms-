---

## 🎯 CORE RATES (The Foundation)

### 1. **10-Year Treasury Yield**
**What it is:** The interest rate the US government pays on 10-year bonds.

**Why it matters:** 
- This is the "risk-free rate" - the baseline for all investing

- When this goes up, borrowing gets more expensive everywhere

**How to interpret:**
- **2-3%:** Low rates, cheap money
- **3-4%:** Normal/moderate rates
- **4-5%:** Higher rates, expensive borrowing
- **5%+:** Very high rates

**Real-world impact:**

### 2. **2-Year Treasury Yield**
**What it is:** The interest rate on 2-year US government bonds.

**Why it matters:**
- Shows what markets expect for short-term rates
- More sensitive to Fed policy changes
- Compares to 10Y to show yield curve

**How to interpret:**

## 🔮 FUTURE FEATURE: BUBBLE INDICATOR

### Coming Soon: Automated Bubble Detection

**What it will show:**
A single "Bubble Risk Score" from 0-100 combining:
- Equity risk premium (low = bubble)
- VIX complacency (very low = bubble)  
- Credit spread tightness (very narrow = bubble)
- Valuation metrics (high P/E = bubble)
- Market momentum (parabolic = bubble)

**Bubble Risk Levels:**
- **0-30:** Normal/Healthy
- **30-50:** Elevated valuations
- **50-70:** Bubble forming
- **70-85:** Advanced bubble
- **85-100:** EXTREME BUBBLE (run!)

**Historical calibration:**
- 1999 Tech Bubble: Would've shown 90+
- 2007 Housing Bubble: Would've shown 80+
- 2021 Meme Stock Mania: Would've shown 85+

**Why this matters:**
- Combines multiple signals
- Removes emotion from analysis
- Historical backtesting
- Clear action signals

**Implementation roadmap:**
1. Define bubble scoring algorithm
2. Backtest against historical bubbles
3. Create visual gauge (0-100 meter)
4. Add warning thresholds
5. Integrate with AI analysis

**Note:** This is a placeholder for future development. The current metrics already give you the raw data to spot bubbles manually!
